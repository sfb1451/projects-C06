abstract: >-
  This project aims at (i) scrutinising the neural
  substrates of motor control when these are affected
  by internal states, and (ii) exploring how primary
  sympathetic effectors affect motor control
  circuits. Task-based fMRI analyses of effective
  connectivity in humans will be employed to generate
  model-based computational indices of neural network
  function of motor control and reward processing.
  These models are then used to test for individual
  expressions of motor function and their modulation
  by standardised pro-dopaminergic treatment as well
  as inflammation.
